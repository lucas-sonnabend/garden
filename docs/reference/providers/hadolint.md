# `hadolint` reference

Below is the schema reference for the `hadolint` provider. For an introduction to configuring a Garden project with providers, please look at our [configuration guide](../../guides/configuration-files.md).

The reference is divided into two sections. The [first section](#complete-yaml-schema) contains the complete YAML schema, and the [second section](#configuration-keys) describes each schema key.

## Complete YAML schema

The values in the schema below are the default values.

```yaml
providers:
  # The name of the provider plugin to use.
  - name:
    # If specified, this provider will only be used in the listed environments. Note that an empty array effectively
    # disables the provider. To use a provider in all environments, omit this field.
    environments:
    # By default, the provider automatically creates a `hadolint` module for every `container` module in your
    # project. Set this to `false` to disable this behavior.
    autoInject: true
    # Set this to `"warning"` if you'd like tests to be marked as failed if one or more warnings are returned.
    # Set to `"none"` to always mark the tests as successful.
    testFailureThreshold: error
```
