# garden.yml reference

Below is the schema reference for the [Project](#project-configuration-keys) and [Module](#module-configuration-keys) `garden.yml` configuration files. For an introduction to configuring a Garden project,
please look at our [configuration guide](../guides/configuration-files.md).

The reference is divided into four sections. The [first section](#project-yaml-schema) contains the project level YAML schema, and the [second section](#project-configuration-keys) describes each individual schema key for the project level configuration.

The [third section](#module-yaml-schema) contains the module level YAML schema, and the [fourth section](#module-configuration-keys) describes each individual schema key for the module level configuration.

Note that individual providers, e.g. `kubernetes`, add their own project level configuration keys. The provider types are listed on the [Providers page](./providers/README.md).

Likewise, individual module types, e.g. `container`, add additional configuration keys at the module level. Module types are listed on the [Module Types page](./module-types/README.md).

Please refer to those for more details on provider and module configuration.

## Project YAML schema

The values in the schema below are the default values.

```yaml
# The schema version of this project's config (currently not used).
apiVersion: garden.io/v0

kind: Project

# The name of the project.
name:

# The default environment to use when calling commands without the `--env` parameter.
defaultEnvironment: ''

# Specify a list of filenames that should be used as ".ignore" files across the project, using the same syntax and
# semantics as `.gitignore` files. By default, patterns matched in `.gitignore` and `.gardenignore` files, found
# anywhere in the project, are ignored when scanning for modules and module sources.
# Note that these take precedence over the project `module.include` field, and module `include` fields, so any paths
# matched by the .ignore files will be ignored even if they are explicitly specified in those fields.
# See the [Configuration Files guide]
# (https://docs.garden.io/guides/configuration-files#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for details.
dotIgnoreFiles:
  - .gitignore
  - .gardenignore

modules:
  # Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or globs that should be scanned for Garden modules.
  #
  # Note that you can also _exclude_ path using the `exclude` field or by placing `.gardenignore` files in your
  # source tree, which use the same format as `.gitignore` files. See the
  # [Configuration Files
  # guide](https://docs.garden.io/guides/configuration-files#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for details.
  #
  # Unlike the `exclude` field, the paths/globs specified here have _no effect_ on which files and directories
  # Garden watches for changes. Use the `exclude` field to affect those, if you have large directories that
  # should not be watched for changes.
  #
  # Also note that specifying an empty list here means _no paths_ should be included.
  include:

  # Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or glob patterns that should be excluded when scanning for modules.
  #
  # The filters here also affect which files and directories are watched for changes. So if you have a large number
  # of directories in your project that should not be watched, you should specify them here.
  #
  # For example, you might want to exclude large vendor directories in your project from being scanned and
  # watched:
  #
  # modules:
  #   exclude:
  #     - node_modules/**/*
  #     - vendor/**/*
  #
  # Note that you can also explicitly _include_ files using the `include` field. If you also specify the
  # `include` field, the paths/patterns specified here are filtered from the files matched by `include`.
  #
  # The `include` field does _not_ affect which files are watched.
  #
  # See the [Configuration Files
  # guide](https://docs.garden.io/guides/configuration-files#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for details.
  exclude:

# A list of providers that should be used for this project, and their configuration. Please refer to individual
# plugins/providers for details on how to configure them.
providers:
  # The name of the provider plugin to use.
  - name:
    # If specified, this provider will only be used in the listed environments. Note that an empty array effectively
    # disables the provider. To use a provider in all environments, omit this field.
    environments:

# A list of remote sources to import into project.
sources:
  # The name of the source to import
  - name:
    # A remote repository URL. Currently only supports git servers. Must contain a hash suffix pointing to a specific
    # branch or tag, with the format: <git remote url>#<branch|tag>
    repositoryUrl:

# Specify a path (relative to the project root) to a file containing variables, that we apply on top of the
# project-wide `variables` field. The file should be in a standard "dotenv" format, specified
# [here](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#rules).
#
# If you don't set the field and the `garden.env` file does not exist, we simply ignore it.
# If you do override the default value and the file doesn't exist, an error will be thrown.
#
# _Note that in many cases it is advisable to only use environment-specific var files, instead of combining
# multiple ones. See the `environments[].varfile` field for this option._
varfile: garden.env

# Variables to configure for all environments.

environments:
  # DEPRECATED - Please use the top-level `providers` field instead, and if needed use the `environments` key on the
  # provider configurations to limit them to specific environments.

source tree, which use the same format as `.gitignore` files. See the
[Configuration Files guide](https://docs.garden.io/guides/configuration-files#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for details.

Unlike the `exclude` field, the paths/globs specified here have _no effect_ on which files and directories
Garden watches for changes. Use the `exclude` field to affect those, if you have large directories that
should not be watched for changes.

Also note that specifying an empty list here means _no paths_ should be included.

### `modules.exclude[]`

[modules](#modules) > exclude

Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or glob patterns that should be excluded when scanning for modules.

The filters here also affect which files and directories are watched for changes. So if you have a large number

For example, you might want to exclude large vendor directories in your project from being scanned and
watched:

```yaml
modules:
  exclude:
    - node_modules/**/*
    - vendor/**/*
```

Note that you can also explicitly _include_ files using the `include` field. If you also specify the
`include` field, the paths/patterns specified here are filtered from the files matched by `include`.

The `include` field does _not_ affect which files are watched.

### `exclude`

Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or glob patterns that should be excluded from the module. Files that
match these paths or globs are excluded when computing the version of the module, when responding to filesystem
